# Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋

I build AI systems with a focus on **design, verification, and human-in-the-loop supervision**.

## What I'm Working On

I'm developing a portfolio of AI applications across multiple domains, each demonstrating:
- **Design thinking** — Documented trade-offs and architectural decisions
- **Verification methodology** — How to know AI outputs are correct
- **Supervision architecture** — Where human judgment enters the loop

## Featured Projects

<!-- Pin your best 4-6 DVS projects here -->

| Project | Domain | What It Does |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| [dvs-legal-contract-flagger](link) | Legal | Extracts obligations and flags risky clauses |
| [dvs-finance-earnings-analyzer](link) | Finance | Sentiment analysis with confidence calibration |
| [dvs-healthcare-deidentifier](link) | Healthcare | PHI removal with verification layer |

## Philosophy

AI handles boilerplate. Engineers who understand systems, constraints, trade-offs, and how to turn vague ideas into real products matter even more.

We're moving from "write code" → "design + verify + supervise."
